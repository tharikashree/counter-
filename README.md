Simple JavaScript Counter
This repository contains a basic webpage that implements a visitor counter using JavaScript.

Description
This webpage demonstrates a simple counter functionality built with JavaScript. It allows users to increment and decrement the count, and potentially (depending on implementation) save a history of the counter values.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Running the Counter
Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Note: The current implementation might require additional server-side scripting to persistently store the counter history using the saveFunc.

Functionality
The webpage provides three functionalities:

Increment: Clicking a button (likely with the ID "increment") calls the incFunc function, which increases the counter value by 1 and updates the displayed count.
Decrement: Clicking another button (likely with the ID "decrement") calls the decFunc function, which decreases the counter value by 1 (but only if the current value is not zero) and updates the displayed count.
Save (Optional): Clicking a button (likely with the ID "save") calls the saveFunc function. This function currently creates a string with the counter value and a comma, but it might require further implementation to actually save the history (potentially on the server-side).
Customization
You can customize the appearance of the counter and buttons using CSS.
The button IDs ("increment", "decrement", and potentially "save") might need to be adjusted based on your HTML structure.
To enable saving functionality, you'll need to implement server-side scripting to store the counter history (e.g., using a database or a file system).
